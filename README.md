# SMU_CaseStudy_14_LargeUnlabeledDataset_Clean-Model-Predict (Python)

Case study for MS Data Science. Work done in collaboration with Kevin Cannon.

Starting with a generic, large, and unlabeled data set, the data was cleaned and explored to select an appropriate model. The random forest machine learning model was selected, and the data was further processed and split in preparation to train the model. Then, the random forest model was used to make predictions on the test set, and model performance was assessed based on accuracy.
